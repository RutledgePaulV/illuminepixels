Hi and welcome to my playground!

My interest in programming began in early highschool with a TI-83+ Silver Edition.
I taught myself TI-Basic by creating little apps that solved physics equations
while 'showing the work'. I quickly got hooked on solving classes of problems instead
of instances and started to prefer programming over video games.

Since then I've discovered personal proclivities for architecture and security, fell in love with 
functional programming, taught myself Clojure, taught my team Clojure, and built a multi-tenant
SOA product platform from the ground up with Clojure and Kubernetes. These days I continue
to lead the technical efforts of our team while mentoring others as we scale our team and product.

### Leadership

- Led a transition from monolithic to SOA architecture
- I identified Clojure and led a successful adoption in 2016
- I identified Kubernetes and led a successful adoption in 2015
- Led transition from customer specific applications to configurable multi-tenant SaaS
- Designed architecture to optimize our costs while letting large regulated customers upgrade at their own pace

### Implementations

- Wrote a predicate expression language grammar and compilers
- Created an NGINX security module for accessing S3 files via signed links
- Implemented a periodic backup / cleanup process with per-customer live restoration
- Implemented a collaborative document viewer using websockets and authoritative server state
- Created a secure web accessible Clojure console to perform database migrations in production
